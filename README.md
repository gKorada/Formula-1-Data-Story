# Formula-1-Data-Story

Key Findings 
There truly is no "Dominant" team in Formula 1, however there is a group of dominant teams that often rotate for control. Newer teams are also startig to overpower teams with pedigree, and are infact on track to overtake older teams throough number of teams and points gained. In regards to points gained, it's a combination of quality and quantity of laps that is the best, but when forced to choose, the quality of laps far outweighs the number of laps.

Lessons Learned:
When looking at the lessons learned for this project, I found 2 seperate categories I could dive into when talking about lessons learned. 

Data Collection:
When acquiirng and working with Datasets that are not made in house (by you or your company), it's extremely important to both clean and make connections in your data before importing it into Tableau. Even when working with the data in Tableau, it's important to have an idea of how the connections will affect your data when looking for variables to compare or use in dashboards.

Data Story:
If you were a driver in F1 looking fro a team, the best path to take is to first go to older team with a better pedigree. Racers who have gone through teams like Ferrari and McLaren have often produced drivers who hav won World Championships when they move to the newer teams
